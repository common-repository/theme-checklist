== Description ==

The Theme Checklist plugin is an unofficial tool to help developers get their theme ready for the WordPress.org theme directory. Install the plugin, then navigate to Tools > Theme Checklist to start checking.

We've compiled a some of the most common theme issues that we see in the theme review queue and put them on our site, [Theme Checklist](http://themechecklist.org). This plugin simply loads in all the latest checks and gives you an easy interface to check off the issues as you check them in your own theme. Each issue has a detailed description with examples to help you avoid the them in your own theme.

Checks are dynamically loaded from the [Theme Checklist](http://themechecklist.org) website to ensure you're always working with the latest version of the checks. If this fails, the plugin will fall back to the bundled checks in checks.json.
